What I Built -
I created a Java console application that allows the user to enter an integer and then determines whether that number is even or odd.
The program outputs a simple message telling the user the result.

Why I Built It -
This small project is about learning and practicing.
User Input Handling – using Scanner to capture input from the console.
Conditional Logic – applying if-else statements to make decisions.
Modulus Arithmetic – using the % operator to check divisibility.
Fundamentals of Java Syntax – understanding Java structure, compilation, and execution flow.

How I Built It -
I wrote this project in IntelliJ IDEA as part of my early Java learning journey.
Steps I followed -
Created a new package then inside this package created Java project in IntelliJ.
Imported Scanner from java.util to read console input.
Wrote logic using the modulus operator - If number % 2 == 0, it’s even. Otherwise, it’s odd.
Displayed the result back to the user through System.out.println.
Tested the program with various numbers to ensure accuracy.

Sample Run
Enter a number: 15
15 is an odd number.
Enter a number: 50
15 is an even number.
